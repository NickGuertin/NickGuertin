<h2 class="blog">Welcome To My Blog</h2>
<p class="author">March 20, 2018  By Nick Guertin</p>
<p class="blog">
  This is my first blog post! I'm not really sure what to write here becuase I am still so new to this whole process of Web Development. I guess I'll start with how excited, exstatic, and basiclly any other extreme word I could use to describe my feelings about completing this course. I know I still have a lot to learn and the journey is far from over but I am still proud of myself for accomplishing my goal of completing this course.
  This blog in particular has been a very daunting task I've sort of been messing around with for the past few days. There is so much that goes into making a proper and responsive blog. From AJAX request to Google API's to Wordpress there is a lot of information and skills required. But enough about my struggle with the blog page. I'll get into my thoughts and feelings about the Savvy Coders TWP WorkForce course itself.
  I really enjoyed my time in the course and I am very sad to see it come to an end even though I won't mind having my Saturdays back. This course has taught me a lot. I came into this probably like most of my classmates, with little to no knowledge about making websites and Web Development in general. So this has a huge learning process for me from day one. From downloading and installing the programs to getting them running on my machine to
  actually using the programs and getting to make some static websites. This has been and awesome experience and one I can not recomend enough if you have an intrest in the tech world.
